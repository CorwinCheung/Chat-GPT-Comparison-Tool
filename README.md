# ChatGPT Comparison Tool Using the OpenAI API, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity

This comparison tool works by taking an input of the question asked on the test and the student answer. It then queries the OpenAI API text completition GPT 3.5 model, 3 times with different temperatures with the question and the clause "X" number of words, so it generates a response similar to the length of the student's. Then it uses the TF-IDF(term frequency-inverse document frequency) vectors and cosine similarity to compute the similarity of the students answers to the three GPT 3.5 model's outputs. <br> <br>
